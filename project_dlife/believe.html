                OUR TENETS OF FAITH AS THEY STAND IN THE BIBLE
                </p>

                <p class="preamble">
                “Earnestly CONTEND for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints” (Jude 3)

                “Take heed unto thyself and unto the DOCTRINE, continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save
                thyself and them that hear thee”.
                (1 Timothy 4: 16) “Mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the DOCTRINE which ye have
                learned; and avoid them” (Roman 16: 17).
                </p>


                <p>
                    GOD’S WORDS AND TEACHINGS:
                
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h2>THE BIBLE</h2>

                We believe that the Holy Bible, consisting of 39 book of the Old Testament and 27 books of the New
                Testament,
                is the inspired word of God. 2 Timothy 3: 16 – 17, Proverb 30: 5 – 6, Revelation 22: 18 – 19. Concerning
                all manner of Christian conducts and work, we take the Bible as the final authority.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <h2>TRINITY</h2>

                We believe that the Godhead consists of three separate, distinct and recognizable personalities and
                qualities, perfectly united in one.
                The father, the Son and the Holy Ghost are different persons in the Godhead, not merely three names for
                one person. Matthew 3: 16 – 17, 2 Corinthians 13: 14, Mathew 28: 19 – 20.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <h2>CHRIST BIRTH</h2>

                We believe in the Virgin birth of Jesus, the only begotten Son of God.
                That he was crucified, buried and bodily resurrected – Isaiah 7: 4; Matthew 1: 18 – 25; Romans 1: 4, 1
                Corinthians 15: 3 – 4.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <h2>REMISSION OF SIN</h2>

                We believe in the absolute depravity, sinfulness and condemnation of all men since the fall of man,
                making them subject to God’s wrath and damnation – Psalm 51: 5, Job 14: 4, Roman 3: 23; 5: 12 – 17, Mark
                7: 21 – 23, Ephesians 2: 1.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <h2>REPENTANCE</h2>

                We believe that repentance is a complete turning away from all known sins and its delusive pleasures
                and that it is required from every sinner before he can truly and effectively believe in Jesus with
                saving faith – Proverbs 28: 13, Isaiah 55: 7, Ezekiel 18: 21 – 23, Mark 1: 15, Luke 24: 46 – 47, Acts 2:
                38, 3: 19 – 20; 20: 21, 2 Corinthians 7: 10, Hebrews 6: 1 – 3.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <h2>CONFESSIONS</h2>

                We believe in restitution, which is the making amends for wrong done against our fellow men,
                restoring stolen things to their rightful owners, paying debts, giving back where one has defrauded,
                making confessions to the offended and apologizing to those slandered so as to have a conscience void of
                offence towards God and man – Genesis 20: 1 – 8, 14: 18; Exodus 22: 1 – 7, Leviticus 6: 1 – 7; Numbers
                5: 6 – 8, 2 Samuel 12: 1 – 6; Proverbs 6: 31; Ezekiel 33: 14 – 16; Matthew 5: 23 – 24, Luke 19: 8 – 9;
                Acts 23: 1 – 5, 24: 16; James 4: 17; 5:6.

                </p>

                <p>

                We believe that justification (or regeneration) is the act of God’s grace whereby one receives
                forgiveness and remission of sins and is counted righteous before God, through faith in the atoning
                blood of Jesus, standing before God as though he had never sinned – Psalm 32: 1 – 2; Isaiah 1: 18; Micah
                7: 19; John 3: 3 – 8; Acts 13: 38 – 39; Romans 3: 24 – 30; 4: 6 – 16; 5: 1 -2; 2 Corinthians 5: 17 – 21;
                Galatians 2: 16; Ephesians 2: 8 – 9; Titus 3: 5; 1 Peter 1: 23.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <h2>BAPTISM</h2>

                We believe that water baptism is essential to our obedience after reconciliation with God. Water
                Baptism is once immersion (not three) “In the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Ghost” as
                Jesus commanded Mathew 28: 19; 3: 13 – 17; Mark 16: 15 – 16; Acts 2: 38; 8: 38 – 39; 19: 1 – 6; Romans
                6: 4 – 5.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <H2>LORD'S SUPPER</H2>

                We believe that the Lord’s Supper was instituted by Jesus Christ so that all believers (all members
                of the family of God) might partake thereof regularly to show the Lord’s death till He come”. The
                emblems used are “unleavened bread” and the juice of “fruit of the vine”. Anyone who eats and drinks
                unworthily bring “damnation”, punishment and chastisements upon himself – Matthew 26: 29, Luke 22: 17 –
                20; 1 Corinthians 11: 23 – 30.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <H2>GOOD CHRISTIAN LIVING</H2>

                We believe that absolute sanctification in the believer’s heart is a definite act of God’s grace,
                subsequent to the New Birth, by which the believer’s heart is purified and made holy. It cannot be
                attained progressively by works, struggle or suppression, but it is obtained by faith in the sanctifying
                blood of Jesus Christ. Holiness of life and purity of heart are central to Christian living – Luke 1: 74
                – 75; John 17: 15 – 17; 1 Thessalonians 4: 3, 7 – 8; 5: 22 – 24; Ephesians 5: 25 – 27; Hebrews 2: 11;
                10: 14; 13: 11 – 12; Titus 2: 11 – 14; 1 John 1: 7; Hebrews 12: 14, 1 Peter 1: 14 – 16.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <H2>TONGUES SPEAKING</H2>

                11. We believe that the baptism in the Holy Ghost is the gift of power from on High that the sanctified
                believer is endued with. It is “the promise of the Father” and when one receives this “gift of the Holy
                Ghost”. It is accompanied by the initial evidence of speaking a language unlearned previously, referred
                to as speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives utterance – Matthew 3: 11; Acts 1: 8; Luke 3: 16; 24: 49;
                John 1: 30 – 33; 7: 37 – 39; 14: 16, 17, 26; 15: 26; 16: 12 – 15; Acts 1: 5 – 8; Mark 16: 17; Acts 2: 1
                – 18; 10: 44 – 46; Acts 19: 1 – 6. We do not teach or instruct people how to speak in tongues: the Holy
                Spirit gives utterance. We also stress the necessity of Purity before Power. The Gifts of the Spirit are
                for today – 1 Corinthians 12: 1 – 31; 14: 1 – 40.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <H2>HEALING</H2>

                We believe that Redemption from the curses of the law, healing of sickness and disease as well as
                continued health are provided for all people through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ – Exodus 15:
                26; Deuteronomy 7: 15; Psalm 103: 1 – 5; Proverbs 4: 20 – 22; Isaiah 53: 4; Matthew 8: 16, 17; 1 Peter
                2: 24; Mark 16: 15 – 18; Luke 13: 16; 14: 12 – 14; 10: 10, Acts 10: 38; James 5: 14 – 16; John 3: 8; 3
                John 2; Galatians 3: 13, 14.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <H2>EVANGELISM</H2>

                We believe that Personal Evangelism is a God – given and God –ordained ministry for every believer.
                Jesus commanded and God requires every believer to be a compassionate and fruitful soul winner, bringing
                others to Christ.
                Matthew 28: 19 – 20; Mark 16: 15; Luke 24: 46 – 49; John 17: 18; Acts 1: 8; 1 – 4; Psalm 126: 5 – 6,
                Proverbs 11: 30; Daniel 12: 3; Ezekiel 3: 17 – 21.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <H2>MARRIGAE</H2>

                We believe that marriage is binding for life. Monogamy is the uniform teaching of the Bible.
                Polygamy is contrary to God’s perfect will and institution. Also, under the New Testament dispensation.
                No one has a right to divorce and remarry while the first companion lives. When a person becomes
                converted, necessary restitution on this line, must be done without delay if he has married wrongly
                Genesis 2: 24; Deuteronomy 7: 1 – 4; Job 23: 1 – 13; 2 Corinthians 6: 14 – 18, Proverbs 31: 10 – 31;
                Malachi 2: 14 – 15; Romans 7: 2 – 3; Ephesians 5: 31 – 33; Matthew 5: 31 – 32; 19: 3 – 9; Mark 10: 2 –
                12; Luke 16: 18; John 4: 15 – 19; Genesis 20: 3 – 7.

                <p>
                    <h2>CHRISTIAN MANNER</h2>

                Christian Dressing & Adornment; We believe and obey what the scripture says and has commanded
                concerning the outward appearance of holy woman after the inward man (heart) is purified and transformed
                in conformity with Christ Image. 1 Peter 3: 2 – 5, 1 Tim. 2: 9 – 11, Hosea 2: 13, Genesis 35: 1, Isaiah
                3: 16 – 20.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h2>NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
                We believe that we are living in the New Testament era and God has given to us the full revelation of
                His word and will. We should not consider the case of any Old Testament character as an excuse to
                obeying the full word of God. Never take shelter under the teaching or outward appearance of any man or
                woman of God which does not conform to the standard of God’s word. They shall not stand for you, but for
                themselves before God in that day. As the men are not to put on women clothing so also they are not to
                do their hair like women. If a man adopts the hairdo of woman he is an abomination unto the Lord. The
                believer’s haircut must not be according to the fashion of the world. The woman also must not have
                haircut like man. The Bible says it is a shame to the woman to be shorn. 1 Cor. 11: 1 – 16.

                </p>

                <p>

                The true follower of Christ must cleanse oneself from all forms of worldliness and worldly adornment,
                such as perming or jerry curling of the hair, use of hair attachment, mini-skirts, split-skirts,
                armpit-exposing blouses; keeping long nails, painting of face, lips, nails, wearing of wigs, and
                whatever Satan introduces into the world to defile the holiness of God’s Children, pollute the body of
                the child of God which is God’s temple. Besides we are warned to desist and hate the spiritual garment
                spotted by the flesh. The holiness of God’s Children. 1 Corinthians 7: 1, Psalm 50: 21 – 22, 1
                Corinthians 11: 3 – 16, 1 Kings 9: 30, Zeph. 1: 8, Jude 23, Eph. 5: 27.

                </p>

                <p>

                The Holy Spirit listed these items to make the men and women of God know and avoid them. To adorn
                yourself with these things makes one a partaker of the “Jezebelic” expression of profanity and the
                abomination that is now standing as a plaque in the holy place – God household of faith. Luke 16: 15,
                Mark 13: 14, Eccl. 1: 6.

                </p>

                <p>

                The Bible reveals the worldliness in adornment that characterized the Old Testament time, which has
                continued to today. The ungodly daughters of Zion borrowed their worldly carnet adornment from the
                heathen nations around them. God had warned Israel not to learn the ways of the heathen. Psalm 106: 34 –
                35, Isaiah 3: 16 – 26, Ephesians 4: 17.

                </p>

                <p>

                We believe that the word “gold’ in the passage above means jewelry, which is a collective word for
                earrings, rings, nose rings, chains, necklace, bracelets: items of ornamentation or bodily decoration.
                Holy woman of old time did not adorn themselves with items of heathen beauty and worldliness which were
                prevalent among the heathen and ungodly society of their day. They clothed themselves with meekness,
                quiet spirit, and holiness, which is in sight of God of great price. They were modest in and outward
                appearance.

                <p>
                We believe that the Rapture (commonly referred to as the first phase or stage of the SECOND COMING
                OF CHRIST) is the catching away from the earth, of all living saints and all who died in the Lord. The
                Rapture will take place before the Great Tribulation and can happen any time from now. “In a twinkling
                of an eye “without a moment’s warning. “the trumpet shall sound” and the dead in Christ shall rise
                first; then we which are alive and remaining shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to
                meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord” – John 14: 1 – 3; Luke 21: 34 – 36; 1
                Corinthians 15: 51 – 58; 1 Thessalonians 4: 13 – 18; 5: 4 – 9; 2 Thessalonians 2: 5 – 7; Philippians 3:
                11, 20, 21; 1 John 3: 1 – 3.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                We believe that the Resurrection of the dead is taught in the Bible as clearly as the immortality of
                the soul. Every individual who has ever lived will be resurrected, some to honour and glory and others
                to everlasting shame and contempt. Job 19: 25 – 27; Psalm 71: 20; Isaiah 26: 19; Daniel 12: 2; John 5:
                28 – 29; 1 Corinthians 15: 12 – 57; 1 Thessalonians 4: 13 – 16; Hebrews 6: 1 – 2; Philippians 3: 8 – 11;
                Revelation 20: 4, 6, 12, 13.
                </p>

                <p>
                We believe that the Tribulation will occur after the Rapture and will be a time of terrible
                suffering on earth. It is also referred to as the time of “Jacob’s trouble” – Matthew 24: 21, 22, 29;
                Revelation 9: 16; Mark 13: 19 2 Thessalonians 2: 3 – 12; Revelation 13. During this time, the Antichrist
                will take possession of this world for a reign of terror. He will not be a system or organization but a
                person – a supernatural, diabolical being, in the form of a man who will blaspheme and proclaim himself
                to be God (Daniel 8: 23 – 25, 2 Thessalonians 2: 7 – 12; Revelation 13: 1 – 10). The Marriage Supper of
                the Lamb will take place above, while the Tribulation continues on earth – Revelation 19: 1 – 10.

                </p>

                <p>

                We believe that the second coming of Christ will be just as literal and visible as His going away,
                and He is coming to execute judgment upon the ungodly. He will also, then, set up His Kingdom and reign
                on this present earth for a thousand years – Zechariah 14: 3 – 4; Matthew 25: 31 – 46; 26: 64; Mark 13:
                24 – 37; 2 Thessalonians 1: 7 – 10; 2: 8; Jude 14, 15.

                </p>

                <p>
                We believe that Christ’s Millennial Reign is the 1,000 years literal reign of Jesus on earth, which
                will ushered in by the coming of Jesus back with ten thousands of His saints. At this time He will judge
                the nations that dwell upon the face of the earth – Jude 14, 15; 2 Thessalonians 1: 7 – 10. During this
                time the devil will be bound – Revelation 20: 2, 3. It will be a reign of peace and blessing – Isaiah
                11: 6 – 9; 65: 25; Hosea 2: 18; Zechariah 14: 9 – 20; Isaiah 2: 2 – 4.

                </p>

                <p>
                We believe that the great white Throne Judgment is when God finally judges all (the living and the
                dead, small and great) who have ever lived on the face on earth, according to their work. This is after
                the Millennium. At this time the final judgment known as the Great White Throne Judgment will be held.
                All those, from all ages, who have not yet been judged (believers judgment, as sinners was accomplished
                by Christ on the Cross – John 5: 24; 3: 17 – 19) will stand before God at this time. The devil and his
                angels are judged at this time also and sent to the lake of fire forever – Daniel 12: 2, 3: Matthew 10:
                15; 11: 21 – 24, 12: 41, 42; John 5: 28, 29: Romans 2: 15, 16; 14: 12; 2 Peter 2: 9; Jude 6; 1
                Corinthians 6: 1 – 4; Acts 10: 42; Revelation 20: 11 – 15;

                </p>

                <p>

                We believe that the New Heaven and the New Earth “wherein dwelleth righteousness” will be made by
                God and the redeemed shall dwell with God forever. This present earth which has been polluted by sin
                will pass away after Great White Throne Judgment (Psalm 102: 25, 26; Isaiah 51: 6; 65: 17; Matthew 5:
                18; 24: 35; 2 Peter 3: 10 – 13; Revelation 21: 1). No unclean thing will be there. We shall know each
                other, our knowledge having been perfected. There will be no curse upon anything. There will be no more
                light; the glory of the Lord will be the light thereof – Isaiah 66: 22; 2 Peter 3: 12, 13; 1 Corinthians
                13: 12; 1 John 3: 2, 3; Revelation 21: 1 – 7; 22: 1 – 5.
                </P>
                
                <p>
                We believe that Hell fire is a place of everlasting punishment where sinners (all who do not have
                their names in the book of life) will suffer torments for ever and ever. It was prepared for the devil
                and his angels (Matthew 25: 41) but God has decreed that the wicked and those who forget Him and reject
                Christ will also be cast there because of their sin and neglect of his salvation – Psalm 9: 17; Matthew
                25: 46; Luke 12: 4, 5; 16: 19 – 31; Matthew 5: 22, 30; Mark 9: 43 – 47; Revelation 14: 10, 11; 20: 10,
                12: 15.
